\begin{abstract}
HIV Envelope (Env) evolves rapidly.
The immediate the evolutionary space accessible to any viral variant is largely determined by the effects of single amino-acid mutations.
However, the effects of these mutations can shift over evolutionary time as the virus traverses through sequence space.
Here we comprehensively quantify the ways in which mutational effects shift or remain constant by experimentally measuring the effects of all amino-acid mutations to two homologs of Env with 85\% (?) sequence identity.
We find...

Deep mutational scanning workflow.
{\bf (A)} For each homolog, we made a library of proviral HIV plasmids with random codon-level mutations in \textit{env}.
We then transfected the plasmids into 293T cells to generate mutant viruses, which may lack a genotype-phenotype link since transfected cell are expected to each receive multiple plasmids.
To establish this link and select for functional variants, we first passaged the libraries in SupT1 cells at a low MOI.
Then, we imposed a second round of selection by infecting the passaged viruses into SupT1 cells at a high MOI and then harvesting reverse-transcribed unintegrated viral DNA at 12 hours post-infection.
Finally, we deep sequenced the libraries before and after selection.
We also deep sequenced wildtype controls to estimate error rates due to PCR, deep sequencing, and viral replication.
Using these sequencing data, we then inferred each site's preference for each of the 20 amino acids.
{\bf (B)} For each homolog, we conducted this experiment in full biological triplicate, beginning at the stage of independently creating the plasmid mutant libraries.

\figsupp[Sanger sequencing of the BG505 mutant plasmid libraries.]{
We Sanger sequenced 44 clones of BG505 Env sampled roughly evenly from each of the three replicate mutant plasmid libraries.
{\bf(A)} There was an average of 1.5 mutant codons per clone, with the number of mutations per clone roughly following a Poisson distribution. 
{\bf(B)} The mutant codons had a mix of single-, double-, and triple-nucleotide changes, with an elevated number of single-nucleotide changes than expected.
{\bf(C)} Nucleotide frequencies were fairly uniform in the mutant codons.
{\bf(D)} Mutations were distributed roughly evenly along the mutagenized region of {\it env} (30-699 in the sequential numbering scheme used here).
{\bf(E)} For clones with multiple mutations, we computed the pairwise distance in primary sequence between each codon mutation and plotted the cumulative distribution of these distances (red line). 
We also simulated the expected distribution of pairwise distances if mutations occurred entirely independently (blue line). 
The observed distribution is close to the expected distribution.

The deep mutational scanning experiments imposed strong purifying selection and led to reproducible estimates of each homolog's amino-acid preferences.
{\bf(A)} For each replicate of each homolog, we deep sequenced the starting plasmid libraries (DNA) and the selected virus libraries (virus).
Bars show the per-codon mutation frequency averaged across all sites after subtracting mutation frequencies determined using wildtype controls (Fig \ref{suppfig:ch3_mutfreqs_supp}).
Mutations leading to stop codons were purged during the selection step to 3-17\% their starting frequencies (see red numbers), indicating strong purifying selection.
Nonsynonymous mutations decreased to 40-50\% their starting frequencies, consistent with a large fraction of amino-acid mutations being deleterious to Env.
Synonymous mutations only decreased to 87-95\% their starting frequencies, as would be expected if synonymous mutations tend to have more neutral effects than nonsynonymous changes.
Panels {\bf(B)} and {\bf(C)} show the correlation in our estimates of each homolog's site-specific amino-acid preferences between experimental replicates, with {\bf(B)} showing the correlation between BF520 replicates and {\bf(C)} showing the correlation between BG505 replicates.
Each correlation plot reports the associated Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranged from 0.59-0.75, indicating that our estimates are largely repeatable between replicates.

The rescaled averaged site-specific amino-acid preferences for BG505.
This logo plot shows the site-specific amino-acid preferences for BG505 after averaging between replicates and then rescaling them using the stringency parameter from Table \ref{tab:phydms} inferred for BG505 from the group-M alignment.
Each site has a stack of 20 letters corresponding to the 20 amino acids.
Letter heights, which sum to one at each site, are proportional to the site's preference for each amino acid.
The top bar (R) indicates gp120 variable loops, other regions in gp120, or gp41.
The bottom bar (WT) shows the wildtype amino-acid sequence for BG505.
Sites are numbered according to the HXB2 numbering scheme~\cite{korber1998numbering}).
