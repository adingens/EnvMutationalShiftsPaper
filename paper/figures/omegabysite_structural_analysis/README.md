# Coloring Env's structure by omega-by-site values

This folder contains two scripts for generating the snapshots of Env's structure colored by omega-by-site value, as made in `PyMOL`.

* *analysis_code_omega_by_site.py*: generates PNG files of the images of the entire Env structure (5FYL) colored by omega-by-site values, as shown in this figure. I copied and pasted these images into the PowerPoint `omegabysite_structural_analysis.pptx` to make the complete figure.

* *analysis_code_conformational_dynamics_network.py*: generates a PyMOL session, which I manually tweaked to obtain an image of Env (5VN3) zoomed in to the region around alpha-helix 0 and the network of hydrophobic amino acids identified by Ozorowski et al., 2017, Nature to be involved in the conformational change that occurs upon CD4 binding.
