This folder contains its own script for generating the snapshots of Env's structure colored by omega-by-site value, as made in `PyMOL`. This script is called `analysis_code.py` and can be run in the `PyMOL` terminal in this directory using the command: `run analysis_code.py`. It will then generate PNG files of the images shown in this figure. I copied and pasted these images into the PowerPoint `omegabysite_structural_analysis.pptx` to make the complete figure.
